# OpenSM
> An open-source reimplementation of the My Singing Monsters client

*This project is unofficial and not related to Big Blue Bubble in any way. By using this, you are required to own My Singing Monsters in steam, and stuff like that. The Steam API is publically available, I did not hack Steam in any way.*
